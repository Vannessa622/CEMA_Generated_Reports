# Introduction

HIV remains a significant public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, with the region accounting for approximately 65% of the 39.9 million people living with HIV globally as of 2023 . Despite advancements in prevention and treatment, the disease continues to impact health systems and socioeconomic conditions, including employment and poverty levels.​

This project utilizes data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank to:​

1. Visualize HIV trends in countries contributing to 75% of the global burden.

2. Examine HIV trends within each WHO region.

3. Analyze the relationship between HIV prevalence and multidimensional poverty, considering factors such as income, education, and access to basic services

## Report: Analysis of HIV Cases and Multidimensional Poverty Factors

### Objective
The analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between the number of people living with HIV and the multidimensional poverty headcount ratio. Key poverty factors included income, educational attainment, school enrollment, electricity access, sanitation, and drinking water. Random effects for regions were incorporated to account for variations across geographic areas.

However, due to significant variability in the "Year" variable, it was challenging to model it as a random effect. Therefore, it was excluded from the model to improve interpretability and model convergence.

## Model 1: Multidimensional Poverty Factors and HIV Cases

The first model analyzed the direct relationship between HIV cases (log-transformed) and individual poverty factors, while accounting for region(which are countries aggregated) as a random effect. Below are the findings:

1. **Random Effects**:

- Variance attributed to regions: 0.9825.

- Residual variance: 1.4312.

2. **Fixed Effects**:

- **Poverty_Headcount**: Negligible negative relationship (Estimate: -0.08416, p > 0.05).

- **Monetary**: Positive but non-significant relationship (Estimate: 0.09616, p > 0.05).

- **Attainment**: Slight positive effect (Estimate: 0.05098, p > 0.05).

- **Enrollment**: No meaningful impact (Estimate: -0.01145, p > 0.05).

- **Water Access**: Significant positive relationship (Estimate: 0.11332, p < 0.05), suggesting better water access correlates with higher HIV cases.

3. **Multicollinearity Issues**:

- High variance inflation factors (e.g., Electricity: 19.06, Sanitation: 12.03) indicated severe multicollinearity among predictors, limiting reliable interpretation.

## Addressing Multicollinearity: PCA Approach

To resolve multicollinearity, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on the predictors, reducing them to two uncorrelated components (PC1 and PC2) which explained 88% of the variance.

1. **Model 2: PCA Components and HIV Cases:**

- Random effect (Region): Variance increased slightly (1.789), capturing regional heterogeneity better.

- Fixed effects:

   -PC1 (dominant contributor to poverty factors): Negative but non-significant effect (Estimate: -0.2982, p > 0.05).

   -PC2 (secondary contributor): Negative but non-significant effect (Estimate: -0.3886, p > 0.05).

2. **Improvement in Fit:**

Lower REML criterion (96.4) compared to the original model (113.4), indicating better model performance.

## Interpretation of Results

- **Significant Predictors:**

   -Water access showed a significant positive correlation with HIV cases in the original model, which may reflect higher reporting accuracy or other contextual factors in areas with improved infrastructure.

- **Dimensional Reduction:**

   -PCA highlighted that no single poverty dimension significantly explains the variation in HIV cases after adjusting for multicollinearity.

- **Random Effects:**

   -Accounting for region proved essential, as it captured substantial variance unexplained by fixed effects

## Limitations

- Excluding Year as a random effect due to its high variability limited the ability to assess temporal trends in the relationship between poverty factors and HIV prevalence.

- Multicollinearity among predictors complicated the interpretation of individual contributions without dimensional reduction.

## Recommendations

**Focus on Regional Interventions:**

- Tailor interventions at the regional level to address the variance captured by the random effects.

**Longitudinal Approaches:**

- Explore alternative methods to model time, such as grouping years into broader categories.

## Interpretation of the Maps

## Question:
The visualization aims to answer this question: What are the latest estimates of key indicators at the country level using shapefiles?

**Map Analysis:**

The visualization includes two distinct maps of East Africa, which display the latest estimates of mortality rates for two indicators: neonatal mortality rates and under-five mortality rates.

1. **Neonatal Mortality Rate Map** (Left Side):

- **Color Gradient**: The map uses shades of purple to depict neonatal mortality rates. Darker purple corresponds to lower rates, while lighter purple represents higher neonatal mortality rates.

- **Findings**:

   - Countries such as **Kenya** and **Tanzania** have intermediate rates, indicated by medium shades.

   - **Somalia** and **South Sudan** likely exhibit some of the highest neonatal mortality rates, as seen by the lighter purple tones.

   - Regions with darker shades, such as **Rwanda**, show lower neonatal mortality rates.
   
2. **Under-Five Mortality Rate Map** (Right Side):

- **Color Gradient**: This map employs a gradient ranging from purple to orange. Dark purple represents lower mortality rates, while orange highlights higher rates.

- **Findings**:

   - Countries like **Rwanda** and **Kenya** appear to have lower under-five mortality rates, shown by darker purple regions.

   - **South Sudan**, **Somalia**, and parts of **Ethiopia** demonstrate higher under-five mortality rates, indicated by orange regions.

**Key Insights:**

- There is a clear spatial pattern where certain countries consistently experience higher mortality rates for both indicators. South Sudan and Somalia emerge as critical areas of concern for neonatal and under-five mortality.

- Conversely, countries like Rwanda have better health outcomes, reflected by their lower mortality rates across the two indicators.

- The contrasting color gradients make it easy to compare and prioritize regions needing urgent health interventions.

## Mortality Rate Analysis in East African Community Countries (2024)

### Objective

This report aims to highlight mortality trends in East African Community (EAC) countries, focusing on the most recent data from 2024. The findings emphasize countries with the highest under-five and neonatal mortality rates, based on visualizations and statistical analysis.

### Findings

1. **Under-Five Mortality Rates**

- **Country with the Highest Rate**: Somalia

- **Mortality Rate: 123 deaths per 1,000 live births**

- **Key Insight**: Somalia holds the highest under-five mortality rate in 2024. This staggering figure suggests severe socio-economic challenges, limited healthcare infrastructure, malnutrition, and inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities. It highlights an urgent need for targeted interventions aimed at improving child health and survival in Somalia

2. **Neonatal Mortality Rates**

- **Country with the Highest Rate**: South Sudan

- **Mortality Rate: 40.2 deaths per 1,000 live births**

- **Key Insight**: South Sudan experiences the highest neonatal mortality rate, which refers to deaths within the first 28 days of life. This figure signals critical shortcomings in maternal healthcare, safe delivery practices, and neonatal care. Improving access to skilled birth attendants and neonatal healthcare facilities is crucial to addressing this issue.

### Visualized Trends

The mortality trends over time, as displayed in the graphs, demonstrate:

1. **Overall Decline**: Both under-five and neonatal mortality rates show a declining trend across the region, reflecting incremental progress in child health initiatives.

2. **Regional Disparities**: Despite progress, countries like Somalia and South Sudan show significantly higher mortality rates compared to the regional average. This underscores the need for equitable resource allocation and country-specific interventions.

### Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Burden Countries:**

Direct resources and interventions toward Somalia and South Sudan to address their uniquely high mortality rates.

Interventions should include improving healthcare infrastructure, enhancing nutritional programs, and expanding vaccination campaigns.

2. **Strengthen Maternal and Neonatal Care:**

Expand access to skilled birth attendants and neonatal care units, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

Promote safe delivery practices and maternal education programs to reduce neonatal deaths.

3. **Regional Collaboration:**

Encourage collaboration among EAC countries to share best practices, resources, and funding mechanisms for child health improvements.

Leverage regional partnerships to implement scalable solutions to child mortality.

4. **Data Monitoring and Evaluation:**

Regularly track mortality rate trends to assess the impact of interventions and adapt strategies as needed.

Develop robust data collection frameworks to ensure consistent, accurate, and actionable insights.

### Conclusion

While the East African region is making progress in reducing child mortality rates, Somalia and South Sudan remain outliers, with alarmingly high rates of under-five and neonatal mortality. Addressing these disparities requires a multi-faceted approach, combining healthcare improvements, socio-economic interventions, and regional collaboration.
